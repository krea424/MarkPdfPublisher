Enable full transcript logging.

Enable full transcript logging.

TEST: auto-logging works end-to-end.

## 2025-09-06T11:50:03+02:00 — codex



Transcript auto-logging is active: this turn has been appended.

Next: initialize the repo and set your GitHub noreply locally.
- Confirm your noreply email from GitHub Settings > Emails.
- When ready, I’ll run:
  - git init
  - git config user.email "<your-noreply>"
  - git config user.name "Moro Moromoro" (unchanged)
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "chore: initial commit (.gitignore, README)"

Also, I’ll add a few safe patterns to .gitignore: .env, .env.*, *.log, .coverage, htmlcov/, .ipynb_checkpoints/.

Proceed with these steps now? (y/n)

Update logging policy (strict):

On every turn:
1) Compute one timestamp now in Europe/Rome (ISO 8601) and reuse it for both files.
2) Append to summary table at docs/CODEX_SESSION_LOG_2025-09-06.md exactly ONE row:
3) Append to transcript at docs/CODEX_TRANSCRIPTS/2025-09-06.md TWO blocks using the SAME {ts}:
   {exact user message}
   {exact codex reply}
4) Show ONE combined DIFF for these two files only.
5) Auto-append without asking y/n. Stop if I write: STOPLOG.
6) Never log secrets ( redact strings that look like API keys or tokens ).

Acknowledge with: "logging policy updated".

logging policy updated

## 2025-09-06T11:54:15+02:00 — user
TEST: updated logging policy — both files should update with the same timestamp

## 2025-09-06T11:54:15+02:00 — codex



Confirmed. Auto-logged this turn to both files using one Rome timestamp and showed a combined diff.

Refine logging policy (final):

    {exact user message}
    {exact codex reply}

## 2025-09-06T11:57:14+02:00 — codex



Logging policy refined and enforced. I will auto-append one summary row and two transcript blocks per turn with a single Rome timestamp, append-only at end, and skip duplicate-role blocks for the same timestamp. Ready to resume: initialize the repo, set repo-local GitHub noreply, refine .gitignore, and commit. Proceed? (y/n)

## 2025-09-06T12:00:32+02:00 — user
TEST: transcript-only blocks; same timestamp as summary

Logged transcript-only test to both files using one Rome timestamp and appended at end; combined diff below.

Resume from saved context (read-only first).

Goal: rebuild working memory from my saved logs so we can continue seamlessly.

Plan (ask before running):
  1) Recent goals/decisions (≤8 bullets)
  2) Open questions for me (≤5)
  3) Next 3 concrete actions with file paths

If clear, propose the exact read-only commands you will run and wait for my “y”.

## 2025-09-06T12:11:21+02:00 — codex



I’ll reconstruct context by reading the latest transcript and today’s session log. Here are the exact read-only commands I propose to run:

```bash
# 1) Detect latest transcript file
ls -t docs/CODEX_TRANSCRIPTS/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -n 1

# 2) Read that transcript (first 250 lines)
TRANSCRIPT=$(ls -t docs/CODEX_TRANSCRIPTS/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -n 1); echo "$TRANSCRIPT"; sed -n '1,250p' "$TRANSCRIPT"

# 3) Read today’s session summary table (first 250 lines)
sed -n '1,250p' docs/CODEX_SESSION_LOG_2025-09-06.md
```

Proceed to run these read-only commands now? (y)

Context snapshot
- Recent goals/decisions:
  - Enable persistent session logging (summary + full transcripts).
  - Auto-logging per turn with one Europe/Rome timestamp and combined diff.
  - Use GitHub noreply email for commits; keep `main` as default branch.
  - Adopt GitHub Flow (protected `main`, feature branches, PRs, squash merge).
  - Use Conventional Commits style for messages.
  - Initialize Git repo in `~/Desktop/MarkPdfPublisher` (not yet initialized).
  - `.gitignore` exists; add patterns: `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.log`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.
  - Next phases after versioning: backend + DB (free, scalable), CI/CD.

- Open questions for you:
  - What is your GitHub noreply email to set locally for this repo?
  - Tech stack focus now (Python/Flask, Node.js, other) to tailor ignores and scaffolding?
  - Public or private repository on GitHub for this project?
  - Preferred license (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0) for distribution?
  - Monorepo vs. single-repo per service (initially suggest single repo)?

- Next 3 concrete actions:
  1) Initialize repo and set local identity: `~/Desktop/MarkPdfPublisher` — run `git init`, `git config user.email <noreply>`, `git config user.name "Moro Moromoro"`.
  2) Harden ignore list: `.gitignore` — append `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.log`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.
  3) First commit: `README.md`, `.gitignore` — `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initial commit"`.

Single clarifying question
- Please confirm your GitHub noreply email (from GitHub Settings > Emails) so I can set it locally for this repo.

Update logging policy: daily rollover (Europe/Rome).

Rules (strict):
  DAY = Europe/Rome current date in YYYY-MM-DD (ISO, e.g., 2025-09-06)
  TS  = Europe/Rome current timestamp in ISO 8601 with timezone
  For summary:
    > Append-only log of Codex IDE agent conversations for MarkPdfPublisher.
  For transcript:
  1) Append ONE summary row to the ${DAY} summary file:
  2) Append TWO transcript blocks to the ${DAY} transcript file (same {TS}):
     {exact user message}
     {exact codex reply}
  3) Always append at end; skip duplicates for the same {TS}+role.
  4) Show ONE combined diff for the two files only.
