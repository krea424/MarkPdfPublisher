# Codex Full Transcript — 2025-09-06

Refine logging policy (final):

- Compute ONE ISO 8601 timestamp (Europe/Rome) per turn and reuse it for both files.
- SUMMARY FILE (docs/CODEX_SESSION_LOG_2025-09-06.md): append exactly ONE table row.
- TRANSCRIPT FILE (docs/CODEX_TRANSCRIPTS/2025-09-06.md):
  - NEVER write table rows here. Only two blocks:
    ## {ts} — user
    {exact user message}
    ## {ts} — codex
    {exact codex reply}
  - Always append at END of file.
  - If blocks for the SAME {ts} and role already exist, SKIP to avoid duplicates.

- Show ONE combined DIFF for the two files only.
- Auto-append; stop if I write: STOPLOG.
- Redact anything that looks like secrets (API keys/tokens).

## 2025-09-06T11:57:14+02:00 — codex
Logging policy refined and enforced. I will auto-append one summary row and two transcript blocks per turn with a single Rome timestamp, append-only at end, and skip duplicate-role blocks for the same timestamp. Ready to resume: initialize the repo, set repo-local GitHub noreply, refine .gitignore, and commit. Proceed? (y/n)

TEST: updated logging policy — both files should update with the same timestamp

## 2025-09-06T11:54:15+02:00 — codex
Confirmed. Auto-logged this turn to both files using one Rome timestamp and showed a combined diff.

Update logging policy (strict):

On every turn:
1) Compute one timestamp now in Europe/Rome (ISO 8601) and reuse it for both files.
2) Append to summary table at docs/CODEX_SESSION_LOG_2025-09-06.md exactly ONE row:
   | {ts} | codex | {≤120 chars summary of codex reply} | {files changed or "-"} | {suggested commit or "-"} |
3) Append to transcript at docs/CODEX_TRANSCRIPTS/2025-09-06.md TWO blocks using the SAME {ts}:
   ## {ts} — user
   {exact user message}
   ## {ts} — codex
   {exact codex reply}
4) Show ONE combined DIFF for these two files only.
5) Auto-append without asking y/n. Stop if I write: STOPLOG.
6) Never log secrets ( redact strings that look like API keys or tokens ).

Acknowledge with: "logging policy updated".

logging policy updated
## 2025-09-06T11:50:03+02:00 — user
TEST: auto-logging works end-to-end.

## 2025-09-06T11:50:03+02:00 — codex
Transcript auto-logging is active: this turn has been appended.

Next: initialize the repo and set your GitHub noreply locally.
- Confirm your noreply email from GitHub Settings > Emails.
- When ready, I’ll run:
  - git init
  - git config user.email "<your-noreply>"
  - git config user.name "Moro Moromoro" (unchanged)
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "chore: initial commit (.gitignore, README)"

Also, I’ll add a few safe patterns to .gitignore: .env, .env.*, *.log, .coverage, htmlcov/, .ipynb_checkpoints/.

Proceed with these steps now? (y/n)
